## üöÄ Usage

### Dashboard View (`td`)

Display your task dashboard with today's tasks and overdue items:

```bash
td
```

**What it shows:**
- üìå **Today's tasks**: Tasks due today
- ‚è∞ **Overdue tasks**: Tasks past their due date
- Tabular format with Line, Created Date, Due Date, and Task description

**Example output:**
```
==== TASK DASHBOARD (2024-01-15) ====

üìå Today:
Line   | Created    | Due Date     | Task
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3      | 2024-01-10 | 2024-01-15   | Review project proposal due:2024-01-15

‚è∞ Overdue:
Line   | Created    | Due Date     | Task
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      | 2024-01-05 | 2024-01-10   | Send weekly report due:2024-01-10
```

### Add Tasks (`add`)

Add new tasks to your todo list:

```bash
add "Task description" [+project] [@context] [due:YYYY-MM-DD] [repeat:daily|weekly|monthly]
```

**Options:**
- `-p <priority>`: Set priority (A-Z)
- `-r <interval>`: Set repeat interval (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`)
- `+project`: Add project tag
- `@context`: Add context tag
- `due:YYYY-MM-DD`: Set due date (optional, defaults to today)
- `repeat:daily|weekly|monthly`: Add repeat tag directly

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic task
add "Buy groceries"

# With priority
add -p A "Important meeting"

# With project and context
add "Review code" +work @urgent

# With custom due date
add "Submit report" +work due:2024-01-20

# With repeat interval
add -r weekly "Take out trash"

# Complete example
add -p A -r monthly "Prepare report" +work @meeting due:2024-01-18
```

### Mark Tasks Complete (`md`)

Mark a task as completed by its line number:

```bash
md <line_number>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Mark task on line 3 as complete
md 3
```

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ Marked as done: x 2024-01-15 2024-01-10 Review project proposal due:2024-01-15
```

### Archive Completed Tasks (`ar`)

Move all completed tasks (lines starting with `x `) from `todo.txt` to `done.txt`:

```bash
ar
```

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ Archived 2 completed task(s) to done.txt.
```

### Recurring Tasks (`repeat`)

Automatically add new instances of recurring tasks based on `repeat:daily`, `repeat:weekly`, or `repeat:monthly` tags:

```bash
repeat
```

This script scans your `todo.txt` for tasks with a repeat tag and due date, and adds the next occurrence when the current one is completed.

### Getting Help

All scripts support traditional help flags:

```bash
# Get help for any script
td -h
td --help

add -h
add --help

md -h
md --help

ar -h
ar --help

repeat -h
repeat --help
```

**Help output includes:**
- Complete usage instructions
- Available options and arguments
- Practical examples
- Error handling information
- Cross-references to related commands

**Alternative help methods:**
1. **Check script usage** by running without arguments:
   ```bash
   add
   # Shows: Usage: add [-p A] <task description> [+project] [@context] [due:YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```

2. **View script contents** to understand functionality:
   ```bash
   cat bin/td
   cat bin/add
   cat bin/md
   cat bin/ar
   cat bin/repeat
   ```

3. **Check if todo.txt exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -la todo.txt
   ```
